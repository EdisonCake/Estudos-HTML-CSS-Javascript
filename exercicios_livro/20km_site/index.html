        <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got all packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
            <ul>
                <li>cellphone, </li>
                <li>iPod,</li> 
                <li>digital camera, </li>
                <li>and a protein bar.</li>
            </ul> 
            
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway</q>.</p>

        <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
        <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 
            <blockquote>Passing cars, <br>
            When you can't see, <br>
            May get you, <br>
            A glimpse, <br>
            Of eternity.</blockquote> 
            
            I definetely won't be passing any cars. &#x1F642</p>
